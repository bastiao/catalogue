            <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>EMIF Catalogue, supports the third-party creation of several types of components (by approved developers), that integrate seamlessly with the platform.</p>

                <p>The idea is allow integration at several levels, and allow the platform users to contribute to the development of the system, with having to understand all the intrinsics that make the system tick.</p>

                <p>In this brief documentation we try to aboard in some detail this system, it's several integration levels, and explain the existing API.</p>

            <h3>Plugin types</h3>

            <p>There are essentially three plugin types, available to third-party developers.</p>

            <div class="span8">
                <h4>Global Plugin</h4>

                <p>Global plugins usually reflect a general view over all the databases for a given user (or for all users).</p>

                <p>This plugins will be available at the root of the system, on the platform user dashboard.</p>

                <p>An good example of a global plugin, is the history feed and the tag cloud. They are informations that take into consideration all the databases, and aggregate data in a certain way, displaying it to the user.</p>

                <h4>Database-related plugin</h4>

                <p>Database-related plugins reflect only views over a specific database data (be it for a given user of for all users).</p>

                <p>This plugins will be available when a user opens a certain database, under section tabs.</p>

                <p>Good examples of fingerprint plugins, are the literature tab, or the extra information tab.</p>

                <h4>Third-party full-fledged applications</h4>
                <p>Third-party plugins don't have any real data integration with the platform. They are complete, full-flegged applications that are linked to the system, through the navigation menu, and usually provide a complete different functionality, though they may share some basis like authentication with it</p>

                <p>The main concept for this plugins, is only integrate the application in the environment.</p>

                <p>Good examples of this full-fledged applications are the future workflow-management system and the EHR4CR platforms.</p>

        <p>The plugin system has a very simple lifecycle, based a re-rendering system. After the initial re-rendering, each time an event occurs (that should be catched through the usual javascript event listeners), the plugin should update the content using self.html() or self.append(), and when it deems ready, execute self.refresh() to update the visualization).

        <p>The diagram follows below.</p>

        <a name="lifecycle" class="anchor"></a><h3>Development Lifecycle</h3>

        <p>Plugin development must follow a proper lifecycle, to maintain sustentability.</p>

        <p>The first step is obtaining administrator approval to develop plugins.</p>

        <p>After the approval has been obtained, the user can create any number of plugins desired. Each plugin can have a series of versions. Although users can develop and live-preview their plugin versions during development. Whenever a plugin version is deemed ready to production, it must be submitted for administrator approval.</p>

        <p>Only after approval, will it be available for the other users. Any further alterations to an already approved version, will remove the approval status, and the plugin will have to be submitted again.</p>

        <p>The plugin version available for the other users, is always the biggest-numbered approved version (considered the latest stable version).</p>

        <p>A diagram of this development cycle follows below.</p>
